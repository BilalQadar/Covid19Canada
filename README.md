# Epidemiological Data from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Canada
Used publically available data to attempt to predict the amount of time before Canada will have 0 COVID-19 cases. Mathematical model used was the SIR model with the assumption that once infected and recovered the human is no longer suseptible. Furthermore, used machine learning (linear regressions) to predict future R0, gamma and beta values for the virus. 

# Disclaimer
This project was a method of simulating a virus over time. However, many assumptions were made about the population growth of Canada. The viruses transmission evolves every day causing the data used to model the virus coffecients becomes outdated quite quickley. Take this project as an interesting look at how the virus may change over time and as a potential way of seeing where in the pandemic cycle Canada is. Refer to the CDC, the WHO and the Canadian government for accurate announcements about the current situation in Canada.
