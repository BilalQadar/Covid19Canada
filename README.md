# Epidemiological Data from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Canada
Used publically available data to attempt to predict the amount of time before Canada will have 0 COVID-19 cases. Mathematical model used was the SIR model with the assumption that once infected and recovered the human is no longer suseptible. Furthermore, used machine learning (linear regressions) to predict future R0, gamma and beta values for the virus. Take this project as an interesting look at how the virus may change over time, but the results produced may not at all be accurate.
